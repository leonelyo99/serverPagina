    "parrafo1": "This is a short summary of my history and how I got to programming. It all started in 2006 when my parents gave me my first computer, I entered the world of computing and when I could I took it apart, cleaned and bothered my parents to buy new components. Between video games and fictional films, I spent several years investigating what computer science was.",
    "parrafo2": "I studied in a technical school specialized in electronics, where during the first years I saw what were electrical circuits, calculations for currents, resistances, etc. There I discovered another world that I really liked, it was the logic and mathematics that made the circuit work.",
    "parrafo3": "Later we were taught logic gates which we used to do boolean algebra where combining different gates we could make an algorithm.",
    "parrafo4": "In the year 2016 in the fifth year I learned Visual Basic to program P.L.C. (programmable logic controller). At that moment I realized which road I wanted to follow. It was not until we saw Arduino, I reaffirmed that. This was what I liked and what I wanted to dedicate myself to. It was at that time that I started studying JavaScript for myself.",
    "parrafo5": "When I graduated as an Electronic Technician, I enrolled in the faculty, in the systems engineering career. But after a while I realized that it was not what I wanted, I did half a year there and all the programming examples were behind with what was currently used. Also the subjects where it was programmed, were very few and after speaking with people who had already received it, I realized that when I received I was going to have to start studying programming almost from the beginning.",
    "parrafo6": "A friend told me that you could go to a Full Stack Programmer course in person and it was one of the best decisions because the people I met there contributed a lot to my development as a programmer, also thanks to this same friend, I developed my self-taught part for further leverage my learning and to this day I continue to learn.",
    "parrafo7": "In the middle of the study I was doing work to pay for these courses. i worked freelance, for programming companies and marketing agencies. And I could continue tell jobs and tell many anecdotes, but I am in a project and I have to continue doing what I like program and create."
